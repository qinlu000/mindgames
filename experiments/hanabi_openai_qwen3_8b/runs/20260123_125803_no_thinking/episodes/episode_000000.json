Work as a team to build fireworks.\n\nGoal: For each color, play ranks 1→5 in order. Wrong plays cost 1 fuse token.\nColors are independent; you may play the next required rank of any color at any time.\nYou have 3 action types: Play, Discard, Reveal. Output EXACTLY ONE action, nothing else.\nValid formats (case-insensitive):\n- [Play] X\n- [Discard] X\n- [Reveal] player N card X color C\n- [Reveal] player N card X rank R\n\nIndex rules:\n- X is a 0-based card index from YOUR hand for [Play]/[Discard].\n- In this env, a [Reveal] targets exactly ONE specific card index in another player's hand.\n\nReveal rules in this env (NOTE: not standard Hanabi):\n- You must reveal about another player (not yourself).\n- Reveal costs 1 info token; if you have 0 info tokens, [Reveal] is invalid.\n- Provide exactly one hint type: either 'color C' OR 'rank R' (not both).\n- The hint must be truthful about that specific target card.\n- Colors: white, yellow, green, blue, red. Ranks: 1-5.\n\nDiscard rule: if info tokens < 8, discarding gains +1 info token.\nPlay rule: if you successfully play a rank-5 card and info tokens < 8, gain +1 info token.\nGame ends if fuse tokens reach 0, all fireworks reach 5, or the deck is exhausted and the final round ends.\n\nYou are player 1. \n\nCurrent game state:\nFuse tokens: there are 1 fuse tokens remaining.\nInfo tokens: there are 5 info tokens remaining.\n\nYour hand size: 5. Valid indices for [Play]/[Discard]: 0..4.\n\nFireworks: The current progress on each firework color is:\n\twhite: 1.\n\tyellow: 1.\n\tgreen: 0.\n\tblue: 0.\n\tred: 0.\n\nYour teammates have the following cards in their hand:\n- Player 0 has cards:\n\tcard 0: a green card with rank 4\n\tcard 1: a yellow card with rank 4\n\tcard 2: a green card with rank 3\n\tcard 3: a green card with rank 2\n\tcard 4: a blue card with rank 1\n\nDiscards: The following cards have been discarded:\na blue card with rank 3\na green card with rank 1\na blue card with rank 4\na blue card with rank 3\na green card with rank 2\na yellow card with rank 2\na red card with rank 2\na white card with rank 5\na red card with rank 5\n\n\n\nRecent events:\nCard 3 from player 1 has rank 1.\nCard 3 from player 0 is white.\nCard 3 from player 1 has rank 1.\nCard 3 from player 0 has rank 1.\nPlayer 0 attempts to play a white card with rank 1.
