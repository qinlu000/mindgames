The user also says that Player 1's card 1 has rank 1, card 4 has rank 1, card 3 has rank 1, card 2 has rank 1. So maybe all of Player 1's cards are rank 1? That would mean my hand consists of 5 cards, each with rank 1. But that would make playing any of them incorrect unless the fireworks for that color are at the correct rank. Since all fireworks are at 0, playing a rank 1 would be correct. Wait, the target is to play ranks 1→5 for each color. So for a color, when the current progress is 0, playing a rank 1 is the first step. So if I have a card with rank 1 of any color, I should play it to progress that color.",

Work as a team to build fireworks.\n\nGoal: For each color, play ranks 1→5 in order.

Output EXACTLY ONE action, nothing else.\nValid formats (case-insensitive):\n- [Play] X\n- [Discard] X\n- [Reveal] player N card X color C\n- [Reveal] player N card X rank R\n\nIndex rules:\n- X is a 0-based card index from YOUR hand for [Play]/[Discard].\n- In this env, a [Reveal] targets exactly ONE specific card index in another player's hand.\n\nReveal rules in this env (NOTE: not standard Hanabi):\n- You must reveal about another player (not yourself).\n- Reveal costs 1 info token; if you have 0 info tokens, [Reveal] is invalid.\n- Provide exactly one hint type: either 'color C' OR 'rank R' (not both).\n- The hint must be truthful about that specific target card.\n- Colors: white, yellow, green, blue, red. Ranks: 1-5.\n\nDiscard rule: if info tokens < 8, discarding gains +1 info token.\nPlay rule: if you successfully play a rank-5 card and info tokens < 8, gain +1 info token.\nGame ends if fuse tokens reach 0, all fireworks reach 5, or the deck is exhausted and the final round ends.\n\nYou are player 1. \n\nCurrent game state:\nFuse tokens: there are 1 fuse tokens remaining.\nInfo tokens: there are 1 info tokens remaining.\n\nYour hand size: 5.
