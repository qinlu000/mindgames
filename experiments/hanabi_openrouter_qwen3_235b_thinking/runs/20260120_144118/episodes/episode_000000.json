Output EXACTLY ONE action, nothing else.\nValid formats (case-insensitive):\n- [Play] X\n- [Discard] X\n- [Reveal] player N card X color C\n- [Reveal] player N card X rank R\n\nIndex rules:\n- X is a 0-based card index from YOUR hand for [Play]/[Discard].\n- In this env, a [Reveal] targets exactly ONE specific card index in another player's hand.\n\nReveal rules in this env (NOTE: not standard Hanabi):\n- You must reveal about another player (not yourself).\n- Reveal costs 1 info token; if you have 0 info tokens, [Reveal] is invalid.\n- Provide exactly one hint type: either 'color C' OR 'rank R' (not both).\n- The hint must be truthful about that specific target card.\n- Colors: white, yellow, green, blue, red. Ranks: 1-5.\n\nDiscard rule: if info tokens < 8, discarding gains +1 info token.\nPlay rule: if you successfully play a rank-5 card and info tokens < 8, gain +1 info token.\nGame ends if fuse tokens reach 0, all fireworks reach 5, or the deck is exhausted and the final round ends.\n\nYou are player 1. \n\nCurrent game state:\nFuse tokens: there are 4 fuse tokens remaining.\nInfo tokens: there are 1 info tokens remaining.\n\nYour hand size: 5.
